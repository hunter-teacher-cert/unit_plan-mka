# Games with p5 Play
by Adam Driggers, Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer, and Marisa Shuman

-----

### General Overview
This unit fits into a class taught in p5.js. Students will be taught how to create sprite and manipulate it in order to make games. We will reference basic game design elements and allow the students to create a game of their own as their final product.

It is assumed that students have a foundational knowledge of JavaScript which includes fluency in variables, conditionals, and for loops. Additionally, this unit serves as a fantastic precursor to a unit on Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

### Motivation for Unit
We have decided to make this unit for a game design course taught in p5. We all teach different p5 courses currently and this could help push student understanding to the next level while also engaging their interests.

### Standards Referenced
* 7-8.CT.6 // 9-12.CT.6: Algorithms and Programming (Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program. // Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.)
* 7-8.CT.7 // 9-12.CT.7: Algorithms and Programming (Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information. // Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data).
* 7-8.CT.8 // 9-12.CT.8: Algorithms and Programming (Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. // Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.)
* 7-8.CT.10 // 9-12.CT.10: Algorithms and Programming (Document the iterative design processes of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences. // Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.)
* 7-8.CT.4 // 9-12.CT.4: Abstraction and Decomposition (Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task. // Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.)

### Lessons

| Title                      | Description |
|----------------------------|-------------|
| [01 Sprite Lab](lessons/01_SpriteLab) | Students will be introduced to the p5.play library and sprites. What's p5.play?  What's a sprite? Create and modify sprites.                    |
| [02 Sprite Lab 2](lessons/02_SpriteLab2) | Sprites interact!  How can we get them to interact in the way we want?                     |
| [03 Sprite Art Lab](lessons/03_SpriteArtLab) | Basic Sprites are boring. Students will explore multiple ways to change the appearance of a sprite using a jigsaw protocol. |
| [04 Mouse Movement Lab](lessons/04_mouse) | Students will learn how to use the mouse to control sprites in this lab.  |
| [05 Keyboard Movement Lab](lessons/05_keyboard) | Students will learn how to use the keyboard to control sprites. |
| [06 Meteor Game](lessons/06_game01) | Students will make a game where they avoid flying objects and collect points. |
| [07 Groups Lab](lessons/07_groups) | Students will explore how to use groups to create multiple copies of a sprite efficiently. |
| [08 Final Project Introduction](lessons/08_final) | Students apply their knowledge to create another game. |
| [09 Play Testing](lessons/09_playtesting) | Students Play each others games and give feedback. |
| [10 Code Review + Presentations](lessons/10_codereview) | Students present their final games to an audience. They articulate how different parts of the code function. |
