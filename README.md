# UNIT PLAN NAME
by Adam Driggs, Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer, and Marisa Shuman

### General Overview
Ideas for Game Design with p5
* Basic Game: pong?  snake?  player/target/danger?  (setting, players, win condition, lose condition?)
* Conditionals
* Basic Sprite - could fit into object-oriented programming (use of an object & third-party functions)
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)

Questions: 
* what skills will we assume students have for this unit?
* what will the end product be?
* what areas are available for student choice?

This unit fits into a course taught in p5.js.

### Motivation for Unit
We have decided to make this unit for a game design course taught in p5. We all teach different p5 courses currently and this could help push student understanding to the next level while also engaging their interests.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

7-8.CT.6 // 9-12.CT.6: Algorithms and Programming (Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program. // Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.)

7-8.CT.7 // 9-12.CT.7: Algorithms and Programming (Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information. // Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data).

7-8.CT.8 // 9-12.CT.8: Algorithms and Programming (Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. // Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.)

7-8.CT.10 // 9-12.CT.10: Algorithms and Programming (Document the iterative design processes of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences. // Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.)

7-8.CT.4 // 9-12.CT.4: Abstraction and Decomposition (Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task. // Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.)
