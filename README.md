# Games in p5.js
by Adam Driggers, Katherine (Kate) Maschmeyer, and Marisa Shuman

-----

### General Overview
This unit fits into a class taught in p5.js. Students will be taught how to create sprite and manipulate it in order to make games. We will reference basic game design elements and allow the students to create a game of their own as their final product.

It is assumed that students have a foundational knowledge of JavaScript which includes fluency in variables, conditionals, and for loops. Additionally, this unit serves as a fantastic precursor to a unit on Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript.

### Motivation for Unit
We have decided to make this unit for a game design course taught in p5. We all teach different p5 courses currently and this could help push student understanding to the next level while also engaging their interests.

### Standards Referenced
List The NY State Computer Science standards you will be covering in this unit. Provide the number and name (e.g. 4-6.CT.1 Computational Thinking, Modeling and Simulation)

7-8.CT.6 // 9-12.CT.6: Algorithms and Programming (Design, compare and refine algorithms for a specific task or within a program. // Demonstrate how at least two classic algorithms work, and analyze the trade-offs related to two or more algorithms for completing the same task.)

7-8.CT.7 // 9-12.CT.7: Algorithms and Programming (Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information. // Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data).

7-8.CT.8 // 9-12.CT.8: Algorithms and Programming (Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. // Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.)

7-8.CT.10 // 9-12.CT.10: Algorithms and Programming (Document the iterative design processes of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences. // Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.)

7-8.CT.4 // 9-12.CT.4: Abstraction and Decomposition (Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task. // Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.)
