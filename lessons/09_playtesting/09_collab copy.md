# Play Testing Collaboration 

## Learning Target
I can <u>get</u> feedback on my game through "play testing."

I can <u>give</u> feedback on others' games through "play testing."

## The Collaboration Aspect
> "Playtesting is a commonly used testing technique for games. This quality control method repeats itself at many points of the gaming application/software design process. A nominated group of players play on-going versions of a game to find failings in the game, and to discover bugs and gaming glitches. It also focuses on describing out the unclear points, increasing fun features or decreasing boredom, etc."

From [TestBytes](https://www.testbytes.net/blog/what-is-play-testing/)

Students will use playtesting to get feedback on their games.

## The Scenario
At the end of several weeks of intense game development using [Make Code Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) students are in need of some play testing.

## The Setup
* Students are paired with a random partner who is unfamiliar with each others games.
* Students decide who's game will be tested first. Students will have badges/hats/stickers that explain what role they are currently; Developer or Tester.
* Developers CANNOT SPEAK! They are give their game in ready state without presenting any background or directions.
* Testers MUST ALWAYS BE SPEAKING! They have to do "think alouds" where they are stating their goals or expectations are for each action they take.
  * ex. "I want to play this game so I'll click 'start'" 
  * ex. "I'm pressing the right arrow to get my player to move right"
* During this time, Developers are making careful observation to see if their game is working as expected.
* Testing can continue for a set amount of time or until the game is no longer playable because of a win/lose condition is met or a bug halts the program.
* Students switch roles and can continue

## Some Keys
* No qualitative feedback is given. This is only to identify how a user experiences a game.
