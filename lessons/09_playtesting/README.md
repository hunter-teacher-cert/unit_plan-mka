# 09 Play Testing Collaboration

## Description
In this lesson students will use playtesting to get feedback on their games. Play testing can be done at any point in the game design process, so students don’t have to be “done” for this step, but they will get better feedback if their games are in a playable state.

## Objectives
- I can get feedback on my game through "play testing."
- I can give feedback on others' games through "play testing."

## Standards
7-8.CT.10 // 9-12.CT.10: Algorithms and Programming (Document the iterative design processes of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences. // Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.)
