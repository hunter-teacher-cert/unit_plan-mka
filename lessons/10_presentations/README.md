# 10 - Presentations and Code Review

## Description
Students should come prepared to present based on the assignment introduced in a previous lesson. 

Presentations are celebrations! Try to use this time to build a culture of support and collaboration among your students. Students should be able to present even if they don’t consider their games “finished.” Non-working games can lead to interesting class discussions so students should not feel embarrassed about non-functioning code.

## Objectives
- I can clearly communicate my design process through an oral presentation and visual aids.
- I can describe and defend technical decisions I made while coding my game.

## Standards
7-8.CT.10 // 9-12.CT.10: Algorithms and Programming (Document the iterative design processes of developing a computational artifact that incorporates user feedback and preferences. // Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.)
