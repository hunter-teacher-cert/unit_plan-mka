# Sprite Lab

## Description
In this two-day lesson, students will be introduced to the p5.play library and sprites. 

On Day 1: Through a code-along, they will learn how to include the p5.play library, then create and modify their own sprites.   During individual practice, students will create sprites with selected attributes. 

On Day 2: Students will explore how sprites move and interact.  Through a code-along students will learn how to control how sprites interact when they collide or overlap.  During individual practice challenges, students will create and modify sprites, then determine how the sprites interact.

## Objectives
* I can define what a sprite is. 
* I can use the p5.play library to create sprites.
* I can set location, size, color, type, and motion attributes for my sprites. 
* I can use gravity on my sprites.
* I can create dynamic and static colliders.
* I can control what two sprites do when they collide.
* I can control what two sprites do when they overlap.  

## Standards
7-8.CT.7 // 9-12.CT.7: Algorithms and Programming (Design or remix a program that uses a variable to maintain the current value of a key piece of information. // Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data).

7-8.CT.8 // 9-12.CT.8: Algorithms and Programming (Develop or remix a program that effectively combines one or more control structures for creative expression or to solve a problem. // Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.)

7-8.CT.4 // 9-12.CT.4: Abstraction and Decomposition (Write a program using functions or procedures whose names or other documentation convey their purpose within the larger task. // Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.)
