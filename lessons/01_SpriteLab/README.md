# 01_SpriteLab

## Description

In this two-day lesson, students will be introduced to the p5.play library and sprites. 

On Day 1: Through a code-along, they will learn how to include the p5.play library, then create and modify their own sprites.   During individual practice, students will create sprites with selected attributes. 

On Day 2: Students will explore how sprites move and interact.  Through a code-along students will learn how to control how sprites interact when they collide or overlap.  During individual practice challenges, students will create and modify sprites, then determine how the sprites interact.


## Objectives
* I can define what a sprite is. 
* I can use the p5.play library to create sprites.
* I can set location, size, color, type, and motion attributes for my sprites. 
* I can use gravity on my sprites.
* I can create dynamic and static colliders.
* I can control what two sprites do when they collide.
* I can control what two sprites do when they overlap.
