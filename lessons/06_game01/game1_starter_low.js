//OBJECTIVE: 
// - An obstacle sprite falls from the top of the screen
// - A player sprite tries to avoid the enemy
// - When the obstacle its the bottom of the screen, points go up and the obstacles falls again from a new location.

// Create variables for obstacle, player, walls, coin, animations, and the score.

// preload all the images for animations.

function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 400);
  
  //setup all sprites and animations
  
  //reset score to zero.
}

function draw() {

  clear();
   
  //move the player
  
  //reset the obstacle if it reaches the botoom
  
  //check for overlaps
  
  //end the game if player and obstacle overlap.
}

// Did you get this far?
// add a way to reset the game without reloading.
// HINT, you can create a boolean variable to keep track of if the palyer is alive or not, and use this in a conditional.
