p5 has a great online editor for creating sketches. [https://editor.p5js.org/](p5 Editor)

You will need to include a link to the p5 play library. [This folder](./starter_template) includes the html with appropriate links, a js file that includes some useful comments for getting started. You can also find loaded into the p5 edtor [here](https://editor.p5js.org/awdriggs/sketches/teBItm3gt);

## Local Development
You can develop p5 and p5.play sketches locally, but you must be running a server. On a mac, remember to run a php server for local development from your sketch directory.

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then go to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see your sketch running
