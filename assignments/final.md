# Assignments

## Project Final - Game
Students apply all the skills they developed during this unit to creating a game using the p5 Play library. This is a summative assessment graded using a rubric. 

### Project Brief
Create a game for the MKA Game Jam. Your game must meet the technical requirements and be bug free. You can work with a another student.

Games will be ranked by a panel of judges on different categories:
- Playability
  + Is the game fun to play? 
  + Is the game appropriately difficult? 
  + Does the game invite repeat plays?  
  + Is the program free of bugs that harm the playing experience?
- Innovation
  + Does the game have a unique playing mechanics?
  + Does the game concept seem original? Is is a new and interesting take on a classic style of game?
  + Does the author approach an engineering challenge in a innovative way?
- Visual Graphics
  + Are the graphics inviting for the player?
  + Does the artwork seem original?
  + Does the artwork add to the enjoyment of the game?

### Technical Requirements
- Game uses AWSD IJKL or the mouse for player interaction.
- Game uses the p5.play physics engine to detect collisions, apply gravity or friction, and/or check obstacles.
- Game should run at an minimally acceptable frame rate of 20fps on a computer with 8gb of ram and a standard browser (google chrome, firefox, or safari). 
- Game must have a win/lose condition.
- Game should be able to be easily reset without refreshing the window.

### Learning Targets
- I can use p5 and the p5.play library to build a browser based video game. 
- I can use conditional statements to create win/lose scenarios and check for sprite collisions. 
- I can incorporate Object Oriented Programming patters using sprite objects. 
- I can use for loops to iterate through groups of sprites.

## Game Presentation and Code Review
Students present there game development process and present code for final review. This is a summative assessment graded using a rubric. 
The Presentation and code review will allow students to reflect on their development process to identify strengths and areas of growth. The goal is for students to increase the communication and presentation skills. 

### Project Brief
You will present your final game and code for review. Your presentation should focus on your game design process, from game conception to finalization. You should highlight both an area of difficulty and success. 
You may be asked to describe particular coding decisions and explain aspects of how your code functions.
You will have no more than 10 minutes to present your game to a panel of 3 people, followed by a 5 minute question and answer period.

### Learning Targets
- I can clearly communicate my design process through an oral presentation and visual aids.
- I can describe and defend technical decisions I made while coding my game.

### Submission
Turn in all supporting documentation for your presentation including slides and speaker notes.
