## Game Presentation and Code Review
Students present there game development process and present code for final review. This is a summative assessment graded using a rubric. 
The Presentation and code review will allow students to reflect on their development process to identify strengths and areas of growth. The goal is for students to increase the communication and presentation skills. 

### Project Brief
You will present your final game and code for review. Your presentation should focus on your game design process, from game conception to finalization. You should highlight both an area of difficulty and success. 
You may be asked to describe particular coding decisions and explain aspects of how your code functions.
You will have no more than 10 minutes to present your game to a panel of 3 people, followed by a 5 minute question and answer period.

### Learning Targets
- I can clearly communicate my design process through an oral presentation and visual aids.
- I can describe and defend technical decisions I made while coding my game.
